# What is DIP?
DIP stand fors Digital Image Processing. It is a gui application that provides a sort of basic routines for  image processing including:
- histogram and transform 
- image filtering 
- convolution, 
- color image palette 
- and much more

It's currently developed using C#, but some day it will be refactored in C++ on Qt platform.
